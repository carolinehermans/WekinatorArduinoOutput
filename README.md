# WekinatorArduinoOutput
This repo contains Processing and Arduino code I wrote in order to get Wekinator output into an Arduino without using a Wifi module. This code is also specific to a project I was working on, so modifications and circuit building and such will be required to get your arduino to do what you want!

## Installation

### VSync
In Processing, go to Sketch>Import Library>Add Library and search for Vysync.
In Arduino, download the zip of this repository: https://github.com/erniejunior/VSync and then add it as a library.

### Wekinator
This repo only contains code to manage Wekinator output: you will still need to hook up inputs to a Wekinator project.
